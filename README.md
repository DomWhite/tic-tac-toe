### Overview

WDI - Project 1
Create a game of Tic-Tac-Toe

___________________________________________________________________________________

### Goals (Real-World Application)

* Build a web application from scratch, without a starter codebase
* Use problem solving to determine game logic for a simple game
* Separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in your application
* Build an application to a spec that someone else gives you
* Build a dynamic game that allows two players to compete
* Have a README.md file that explains your app

___________________________________________________________________________________

### Technical Requirements

Your app must:
* Render a game board in the browser
* Switch turns between X and O (or whichever markers you select)
* Visually display which side won if a player gets three in a row or show a draw/catâ€™s game if neither does
* Optionally use a webservice, eg http://placehold.it, to load images
* Have separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
* Use a local storage system to simplify data storage and retrieval
* Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) principles
* Use jQuery or pure javascript API for DOM manipulation
* Be deployed somewhere where the rest of the world can see it
* Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)

___________________________________________________________________________________

### Technologies used

* HTML5, CSS3
* JavaScript
* Jquery Library
* JSON (localStorage access)

### Approach 

* Pen and paper mock up of core requirements
* Created relevant folders and files
* Created repo and link to GitHub
* Reproduced game logic from mock up in Javascript
* Applied styling via CSS
* Integrated more features i.e. keeping score, identifying player and localStorage to keep high score 

### Unsolved Problems

* Wrangling CSS
* Completing round 2 of double or nothing. Specifically integrating the second game board and tracking the score.
* Utilising Jquery library to fullest extent
* Keeping it DRY

### Future

* Integrating AI opponent or multiplayer via multiple computers

### Deliverables

* README.md file explaining the technologies used, the approach taken, unsolved problems, etc

* Link to Github repo:
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/DomWhite/tic-tac-toe)

* Link to a hosted version of game:
